I am a CNRS researcher working on physical oceanography at the Laboratoire d'Océanographie Physique et Spatiale ([LOPS](https://www.umr-lops.fr/en)) in Plouzané, France.  
 
Currently, my research focuses on the physical processes that control salinity variability and their modification by climate change.
